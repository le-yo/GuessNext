A GuessNext Android game I developed over christmas for small nephew and siblings

Concept:

A series of images of family members are in built in the app. 
These images are randomized and appear after a next button is clicked.
The task is to guess correctly which image will come up next.

For every right answer, a user gets 3 points, for each wrong the user loses 1 point.


Improvements that can be made:

Ideally a user should be able to create a new game by taking a number of pictures.

So if this can be improved to allow a user to take pictures and create his/her game it will be more interesting and 'localized'.
